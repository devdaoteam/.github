# DEVDAO WHITEPAPER
###### Based on TON Blockchain.
###### 4 Jan 2023

### Introducing
DevDao's goal is to gather a community of developers who are ready to create projects for users, to improve and strengthen the DAO community with strong projects. All our projects are open source for Product Owners.

### Part 1. DevDao Jetton (DDJ)
Jetton to distribute shares in the DevDao team. To receive DDJ, a DAO participant must participate in the development or promotion of existing projects, or create their own, useful for the DAO project. Emission is unlimited.
The amount of DDJ received for the work is determined by general voting (in DevDao chat), using MultiSig Wallet (based on xJet API), where the entire coin issue is stored.  Voting requires 50 DDJ on the wallet balance in order to confirm the vote. Transferring DDJ to a third-party wallet not associated with you/your account and/or transferring an incomplete amount and a portion of it means sharing your stake in DevDao.

### Part 2. DevDao NFT (DDN)
Non-Fungible Token DevDao is used to access DAO projects, allowing you to get a share in the project.

### Part 3. DevDao Custodial Wallet (DDCW)
Custodial Wallet is used to confirm the vote. There are 2 coins available in the wallet - DDJ for share distribution and TON for commissions and profit.

Voting launch on the wallet is available only in DevDao chat. Only DDN Holder has access to the chat. To vote you need to have 1% of all DDJ emission on your wallet balance in order to confirm your vote.

### Part 4. DevDao DNS (3DNS)
Free *.devdao.ton for projects inside the DAO.

### Part 5. DevDao Chat
Chat access is regulated by the bot, and only DDN holders can join. Passing the NFT results in the exclusion of the participant from the chat. Voting in the chat room is for any events.

Adding or excluding bots and users is decided by general voting, where 80% of DAO must vote. Create a vote can any of the admins of the forum

### Part 6. DevDao Team Roles
РО (Product Owner) becomes the person who created the project or selected by voting of the DAO, one person can not supervise more than 3 projects. PO is the owner of 3DNS for the project. The PO may be re-elected by a vote of the entire DAO. The PO is engaged in the development of the project's whitepaper, which is engaged in recruiting the team, the order within the project's chat room and the distribution of team shares, building processes and interactions within the project You can only submit a project for DDJ collection if you have a complete description of the project.

GA (Github admin) can create and delete new projects in github by voting dao. Administrators are appointed by voting.

CA (Chat admin) can create and close new threads in the forum on Telegram. Administrators are appointed by voting.

WPA (WhitePaper Admin) are users who have the right to merge or close PRs based on voting results, people without uprooting who cannot merge PRs. Administrators are appointed by voting.
Confirmation is given by the results of the PR check:
1. All commits are in English, explaining the changes in WhitePaper briefly and clearly.
2. The description and title of the commit are in English and clearly explain the changes.

### Part 7. DevDao WhitePaper (DDWP)
DDWP is the main DAO document which regulates all processes within the DAO.
The current WhitePaper is based on the reasoning of the original DevDao team and can be nominated for change by vote. To vote to change the WhitePaper, you must have 5% of the issue of all coins.
DevDao founders, with a full vote, have the right to make changes to the WhitePaper.

To change the DDWP, you need to create a pull request to the whitepaper repository (link). The PR must be entirely in English, including commits, header, description. After the PR is created, a vote is created in DDC using DDCW, the github account administrator will attach a screenshot of the voting results to the PR and close or publish the changes to the main branch.
